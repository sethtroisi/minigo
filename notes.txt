== v5 notes

1. 3/4 of the way through v125, change squash from 0.95 => 0.98, change temp cutoff
to move 30 (from 31, because odd number = bias against black)

1. v192 -- learning rate erroneously cut to 0.001.  v207 returned to 0.01.
(v206 trained with 0.001, v207 @0.01)

1. v231 -- moved #readouts to 900 from 800.

1. v 295-6 -- move shuffle buffer to 1M from 200k

1. v347 -- changed filter amount to 0.02.  (first present for v347)

1. v348 reverted #4

1. v352 change filter to 0.03 and move shuffle buffer back to 200k

1. during v354 (for 355) change steps per generation to 1M from 2M, shuffle
buffer down to 100k

1. 23.2M steps -- change l2_strength to 0.0002 (from 0.0001)

1. v360ish -- entered experimental mode; freely adjusted learning rate up and
down, adjusted batch size, etc, to see if valnet divergence could be fixed.


== v7

Rolled back to v5 model 173 and continued from there; first v7 model was
174.  Moved minimum games before starting training
from 5k up to 10k.

1. for 215, adjusted validation set to be last 30 models instead of last 50.
It's hard coded and non-adaptive but it's an easy fix to make on a sunday :)

1. Easy change on a sunday = famous last words.  Also at 215, also discovered
haven't been writing holdout games for models 174-onwards.  Oops.  Should make
for an interesting spike on tensorboard's validation error now as the
validation set will be entirely games from 215.  This new cc image ends up
causing disk pressure on the nodes leading to all the jobs stopping.  Sigh.

1. 217 onwards -- resign disabled amount is 10%, not 5%.
